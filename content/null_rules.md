# Rules to follow in Null
> **Watch Local** - always keep an eye out for neutrals/oranges/reds. Use [UBL’s Unfucked Overview](./tools#overview-settings) (found in the corp MoTD) as this will show neutrals as bright yellow in local, making them easier to spot when they appear in the system. If you’re mining/ratting/otherwise undocked, and a neutral pops into the system, warp to the nearest station immediately. Standings of other capsuleer are based on corporation and alliance settings.

> **Use DScan** - DScan has a max range of 14.3 AU and can help you determine where neutrals are camping in a system. Pressing V continuously whilst adapting your angle (this will point in whichever direction the camera is looking) and range will help you keep track of their movements. 

> **Use Intel** - there are numerous intel channels for each Imperium region. Other players will report neutral sightings in systems. Combine this with SMT (a visual and audio aid for intel movements) and you’ll have an effective early-warning system to help keep you safe. Make sure you get yourself safe before reporting any intel in your system. You can also ask for the status of a system in intel. 

> **Bounce** - when travelling between systems with neutrals, even in a shuttle, it’s recommended to “bounce” around instead of flying gate-to-gate. Fly to a celestial that sits at an odd-angle to the out-gate, then fly to the gate. This will help avoid drag bubbles and smart bombers (the latter of which shuttles are vulnerable to). This is especially necessary at regional gates where campers tend to sit more frequently. 

> **Scout** - use an alt in a shuttle to scout ahead if moving between systems. At worst, you’ll lost a shuttle to a smartbomber if it all goes tits up. Having a scout is one of best ways of increasing your survival chances when navigating around nullsec. If you don’t have a second account, then at least scout one jump ahead in a shuttle on your main if moving something expensive. While not as reliable as real-time scouting, this can still help. Alternatively, ask for the status of a system in intel.
