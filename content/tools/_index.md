## [SeAT](https://github.com/eveseat/seat)
    SeAT is an open source project that helps corporation and alliance managers to keep an eye on everything. SeAT will ask you for full ESI access, the characters you need to register to seats depends on the requirements of the organization that's asking. Everything that your character sees in game is visible through ESI. SeAT also provies you with Statistics about your characters and a way to access in-game information such as mails.

## [EvePraisal](https://evepraisal.com/) / [Goonpraisal](https://goonpraisal.com)
A tool that checks prices for a list of items against the market. Just select a list of items in game, press CTRL+C, and paste inside evepraisal.

Goonpraisal does the same thing, but will add Imperium trade hubs to the list of markets as well.

One very useful setting is the "price percentage" option, which applies a rate on prices from the market. This will help you calculate prices based on the rates communicated by the buyback service of your choice.
