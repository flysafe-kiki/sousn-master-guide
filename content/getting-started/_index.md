## 0. Before joining the corp 
- [Corp and alliance SeAT](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11SRB9JGIfNDzPp7MZjsrqOnOOkc8Fo2x0DdeiR3KsRE/edit): make sure to follow the first part of this document. More information on SeAT [here](/tools#seat)

## 1. First orders of business after joining the corp
### Paperwork

- [Goonfleet Authentication](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1O2WLhvFuDs_4W6ZDxjP9fpcUU7uodcfvmihi7Cv3IHw/edit): follow-up to the document you first went through before joining the corp. **You need to setup authentication for Goonfleet**. This will provide a range of services useful to work with the [coalition](#the-imperium-coalition) such as the Goonswarm forums and communication tools such as [Mumble](./content/tools.md#mumble) and [Jabber](./content/tools.md#jabber), both of which are **hard requirements** to participating in fleets and thus engaging in [PVP](./content/pvp.md) activities with the Imperium.
- [IGC SeAT](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11SRB9JGIfNDzPp7MZjsrqOnOOkc8Fo2x0DdeiR3KsRE/edit): same deal as above with the SouSN seat
- [IGC Discord & Teamspeak](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11SRB9JGIfNDzPp7MZjsrqOnOOkc8Fo2x0DdeiR3KsRE/edit): mandatory to participate in alliance-wide fleets

### Moving in
As part of the Imperium, SOUSN members have access to a [vast amount of null sec systems](https://www.verite.space/maps/coalition/coalitioninfluence.png), in and around **Delve**.

You're free to setup your own personal home wherever your see fit in Imperium space, but staying close to [one of our main hubs](#corporation-headquarters-and-logistics) will  make your life easier, since you'll most likely find a fellow corpmate with the ability to haul stuff for you.

**Do ping your corpmates on Discord or in the corp channel if you need help hauling your stuff !**

## 2. Life in Sov Null
### Rules to follow
See [Rules to follow](./null_rules)

This guide contains a few useful hints and tips to help increase your chances of survival in nullsec. There are many things to consider when travelling around and using space, and keeping some basic things in mind will help avoid silly mistakes, and keep your ships safe. 


### War Declarations
We're permanently wardecced by a few different corporations which operate in highsec and **gank war targets in and around trade hubs**.

Our current alliance has a strict low-tolerance policy for losses to those kinds of ennemies that are easily avoided by using alts or [hauling services](#hauling-services).
This so called "stupid tax" will have you pay the alliance twice the cost of your loss. 

**General rule of thumb is: consider highsec a dangerous warzone, and don't fly valuables through it, and especially not trade hubs**.

### Corporation Headquarters and Logistics

Here are the 3 main systems that are relevant to the corp:
- **P-ZMZV - Dracarys Prime**: This is the Alliance Staging (Querious), meaning alliance fleets will start from here. 
- **1DQ1-A - 1-st Imperial Palace**: This is the trade hub for the Imperium: basically our null Jita. Setting up shop not too far from it is a good idea.
- **39P-1J - RIP Piercing. You will be missed**: The corp's Industry Hub in Delve, where a fair chunk of your fellow corpmates have setup shop. Being close by can help you collaborate with others and get your industry enterprise rolling faster. [Find out more about industry](./industry.md)

### HUD setup
A good overview setup is the basis for surviving in null and be efficient at whatever you do. See (./tools#hud-setup) for suggestions on how to get the most out of your hud and overview.

## Making ISK
Making ISK is a major concern for most players, for various reasons, from funding PVP activities to the simple enjoyment of seeing a virtual wallet grow. 
Before your start preparing for one of the following activities, do consider that corp members can benefit from the alliance's [Ship Replacement Program](./pvp#ship-replacement-program-srp), which can considerably reduce your PVP spendings.

- [**Ratting**](./pve#ratting): The act of blowing NPC pirates, generally in combat sites.
- [**PI**](./pve#planetary-industry-pi): A good way to make passive income. Members will generally have multiple alts running planetary interaction to multiply the income.
- [**Mining**](./pve#mining): If you enjoy shooting at rocks, mining is a very easy way to finance your shenanigans.
 

> **Advice from your devoted author**: if you've just arrived in null, setting up Planetary Interaction is a good idea. It'll make sure that you at least have **some** kind of income, and it's easy to sell the materials you'll extract from it through [buyback services](#buyback-services)


### Buyback Services
Buyback services are a way for you to sell anything that you have lying around.

The way these works is that they'll usually communicate buying rates in advance (rates vary depending on the buyback service, location of the contract, market ...), and ask you to contract the items you wish to sell at the price they listed.

Once that's done, they'll accept the contract, and do with it what they wish.
Price listing usually uses [EvePraisal](./content/tools#EvePraisal)
